# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Awesome N8N MSP Nodes**! üéâ  
This project thrives on community involvement ‚Äî whether you're adding new nodes, fixing broken links, or helping curate categories.

## Where to Start

Check out open issues labeled:

- [`help wanted`](https://github.com/themookfactory/awesome-n8n-msp-nodes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)  
- [`bug`](https://github.com/themookfactory/awesome-n8n-msp-nodes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)  
- [`curation`](https://github.com/themookfactory/awesome-n8n-msp-nodes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acuration)

---

## Curation Guidelines

- Nodes with no development activity for **12+ months** may be removed.  
- Nodes that are **non-working** or have persistent errors may be removed.  
- Unmaintained nodes without an active community may be removed.  
- Nodes with **serious or unpatched security issues** will be removed.  
- Dead links should be reported (you can also submit a PR to fix them!).  

---

## Adding a Node

1. Open `README.md` and find the right category (RMM, PSA, etc.).  
2. Add a new entry in this format:

   ```markdown
   - [Project Name](https://github.com/example/repo) - Short description (‚â§80 characters).
   ```

   ‚úÖ Correct: `- [NinjaOne Node](https://github.com/example/n8n-ninjaone) - Automate NinjaOne workflows.`  
   ‚ùå Avoid: `- [NinjaOne Node](https://github.com/example/n8n-ninjaone) - The best node ever.`

3. Keep entries **alphabetical** within each category.  
4. Use clear, concise, objective descriptions. No marketing fluff.  
5. Submit a Pull Request with a descriptive commit message, for example:

   ```
   add NinjaOne Node
   ```

If you‚Äôre not comfortable sending a PR, open a new [issue](https://github.com/themookfactory/awesome-n8n-msp-nodes/issues) with the details.

---

## Adding a Category

If a node doesn‚Äôt fit into an existing category:

- Propose a new category in your PR (e.g., *‚ÄúDistributors & Vendors‚Äù*).  
- Categories should have **at least 3 related tools or services** before being created.  
- If in doubt, use **Miscellaneous** until enough nodes exist for a new category.

---

## Removing a Node

To remove a node:

- Edit `README.md` and delete the line.  
- Commit with a message like:

  ```
  remove NodeName (reason: unmaintained)
  ```

---

## General Rules

- Avoid redundant terms in descriptions like ‚Äúopen-source‚Äù or ‚Äúfree‚Äù (often implied).  
- Prefer shorter forms:
  - ‚úÖ `Minimalist text adventure game`
  - ‚ùå `A minimalist text adventure game`
- If docs are not in English, add `(documentation in $LANGUAGE)` at the end.  
- Forked projects should note their origin: `(fork of ProjectX)`.  
- If a project distributes only a static binary, add its language: `(written in Go)`.

---

## What Does Not Qualify

- Nodes that are not public or have no documentation.  
- Nodes that are commercial-only without a free/community edition.  
- SDKs, libraries, or anything requiring significant app code to be useful.  
- Generic DevOps/container/deployment tooling (those belong in [awesome-sysadmin](https://github.com/awesome-foss/awesome-sysadmin)).
